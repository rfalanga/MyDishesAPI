I'm following the Pluralsight course, "Building ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs" by Kevin Dockx. Note: I've created this repo and VS 2022 project using the name MyDishesAPI. I'll be following along, but may decide to fork Kevin's repo at some future point.

## .NET version

I started this project using .NET 9.
